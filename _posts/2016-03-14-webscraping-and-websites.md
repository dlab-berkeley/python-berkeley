Come on **Monday, March 14 from 5-6:30pm** in the D-Lab (**356 Barrows**).

## Info
Today, we will explore the possibilities of Python on the web. We will begin by looking at HTML, the layout structure of the web, and use Python to scrape through many websites, looking for useful information. There will also be time for discussion and for groups to try making their own web scrapers in Python.

Please do, at minimum, run through the [beginner tutorial](http://try-python.appspot.com) and try to follow the [setup instructions](http://python.berkeley.edu/learn/#set-up-your-computer). Also, we'd love if you can go through [these exercises](https://bids.github.io/2016-01-14-berkeley/python/00-python-intro.html). If you get stuck, we can help: [email me here](mailto:marwahaha@berkeley.edu) or stop by the D-Lab in 356 Barrows.
