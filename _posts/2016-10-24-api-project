## Overview
We will begin our semester project by using the Twitter REST API to gather data about this year's election.

You can find the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Dv7La-7HM80TR3s4TuA5EkixubruNEXACX4h0q2-Qn0/edit?usp=sharing), and the Jupyter Notebook download [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3D_PdrFcBfRaG5zcXQyYW1QR1k/view?usp=sharing).

Will this be your first week in the working group? Be sure to check the [setup instructions](http://python.berkeley.edu/learn/#set-up-your-computer) to get started. If you get stuck, we can help!
