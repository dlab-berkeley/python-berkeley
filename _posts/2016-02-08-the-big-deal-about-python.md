What's the big deal about Python? Stop by on **Monday, February 8 from 5-6:30pm** in the D-Lab (**356 Barrows**).

## Info
Today will be an introduction to Python and its possibilities. After, we'll do a meet and greet to see how others use Python in an academic setting, and set up discussion topics for the next few meetings.

Be sure to check the [setup instructions](http://python.berkeley.edu/learn/#set-up-your-computer) to get started. If you get stuck, we can help!
