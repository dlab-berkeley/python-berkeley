Come on **Monday, April 4 from 5-6:30pm** in the D-Lab (**356 Barrows**).

## Info
Today, we will explore the possibilities of Python on the web via APIs. There will also be time for discussion and for exploration via the NYTimes API.

The notes for this lesson are right here:

Please do, at minimum, run through the [beginner tutorial](http://try-python.appspot.com) and try to follow the [setup instructions](http://python.berkeley.edu/learn/#set-up-your-computer). Also, we&#39;d love if you can go through [these exercises](https://bids.github.io/2016-01-14-berkeley/python/00-python-intro.html). If you get stuck, we can help: [email me here](mailto:marwahaha@berkeley.edu) or stop by the D-Lab in 356 Barrows.


## Notes

This is the [Jupyter notebook](../03_lecture_code_kunal_040416.ipynb) that I used (kunal). It has the solutions to the challenges, plus a bit more. Check it out! Here's a [PDF version](03_lecture_code_kunal_040416.pdf), and here's the [output csv file](test.csv).
