## Overview
Today, we will go over even more basics of the Python language, with more practice problems and a focus on some final Python tricks.

You can find the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12mgnnNGzixv9kWbSR85IwY-5YxXKxS8woWP_9BllCkw/edit?usp=sharing), and the Jupyter Notebook download [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3D_PdrFcBfRQmp2aWdEanNjZmM/view?usp=sharing).

[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3D_PdrFcBfRaUVVSk83a19jUjA/view?usp=sharing) are some practice problems to work on before class (totally optional!)

Will this be your first week in the working group? Be sure to check the [setup instructions](http://python.berkeley.edu/learn/#set-up-your-computer) to get started. If you get stuck, we can help!
