## Campus groups
The Python community is quite welcoming! There are a variety of places on campus to get help, get involved, or stay in touch.

#### The Hacker Within 
THW is a weekly meeting about scientific computing.
The Hacker Within supports the development of your inner hacker, in a [weekly meeting in BIDS](http://bids.berkeley.edu/about/directions-and-travel) for sharing skills and best practices for scientific computation. You can find out more on their website: [http://thehackerwithin.github.io/berkeley/](http://thehackerwithin.github.io/berkeley/)

#### Python Practice Working Group
You are on our page! We meet weekly at the D-Lab. We hold informal weekly meetings teaching and learning about different topics in the Python programming language, especially for social science, data science, and visualization. You can [subscribe to our mailing list here](https://groups.google.com/a/lists.berkeley.edu/d/forum/pythonpractice). 

#### py4science
The py4science mailing list is still functional. This is a general campus discussion and announcement list for Python. [Subscribe here!](https://calmail.berkeley.edu/manage/list/listinfo/py4science@lists.berkeley.edu)

#### Data Science Resource List
[This is a listing of data science groups](http://marwahaha.github.io/datamap/support) at UC Berkeley, where you can get help.

#### Prior groups in D-Lab

Social Computing Group [used its mailing list archive as its
website](https://www.mail-archive.com/socialcomputing@lists.berkeley.edu/). The Python Work(ers) Party has its [Twitter account
here](https://twitter.com/PyWorkParty), and its [archives are here](http://python.berkeley.edu/events/archive/).
