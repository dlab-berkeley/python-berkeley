## Zero-installation intros

These resources include an integrated python interpreter that
works through your web browser. To use the other resources, you'll
need to get access to a python interpreter (described in the next
section).

 - [Codecademy Python Track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python)
 - [learnpython.org](http://www.learnpython.org/)

## Getting Python

Simple consoles: [PySchools](http://doc.pyschools.com/console) and [Codecademy Labs](http://labs.codecademy.com)

The **easy** way, hosted IPython in your browser: [Wakari.io](http://wakari.io)

If you are using OS X or Linux (or similar), you likely already have Python
installed. You can just run `python` from the command line. (If you don't know
how to run things from the command line, it's probably easiest to start with
the Wakari link above, so you only have one thing to learn! If you want more
of a power-user experience then you can start with the 
[Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/).)

If you install Python, you should follow [the instructions on
the IPython page](http://ipython.org/install.html). (IPython is an enhanced shell for Python.)

## E-books

 - [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html)
 - [6 Free ebooks for python](http://readwrite.com/2011/03/25/python-is-an-increasingly-popu)
 - [Python for Data Analysis](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/python/9781449323592)
   (a great intro to real scientific computing with Python)
 - At Berkeley, we have access to the following e-book catalogs (which includes the Data Analysis book above):
    - [O'Reilly Safari Bookshelf](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/)
    - [Springer Link](http://link.springer.com/search?facet-content-type=%22Book%22)

## Data / scientific computing

[Python for Data Analysis](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/python/9781449323592) is a great place to get started.
Or, you can learn about these tools from their websites:

 - [Pandas for reading / manipulating data](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
 - [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/index.html) (the most common graphing library, includes a great
   [gallery](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html))

# At Berkeley
UC Berkeley has a lot of great resources for learning scientific computing and data science.  There are classes, tutorials, reading groups,
 institutes, and much more.  Here is a short list of some things worth checking out:
 
## Scientific computing resources at UC Berkeley
- [The D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu)
- [The I-school masters in data science](http://datascience.berkeley.edu)
- [The Berkeley Institute for Data Science (more details soon)](http://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/datascience/bids-launch-dec-12)
- [The Berkeley VC for research page on data science](http://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/datascience)

## Python Courses at UC Berkeley
- [CS9H](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~selfpace/class/cs9h/index.shtml) - Self-paced Python course. Requires some programming background. Good for people that know another language and want to pick up Python.
- [AY250](http://profjsb.github.io/python-seminar/) - "Python computing for science." More advanced python course for scientists. 

## Bootcamps at UC Berkeley
- 3-day [Python Boot Camp](http://www.pythonbootcamp.info/home) in the Fall.
- Various software carpentry bootcamps, check their [main site](http://software-carpentry.org/bootcamps/index.html) for bootcamp dates
