### Notices

The [Python Workers Party](/events/2014/01/31/a-new-format.html) meets the
*first* and *third* Friday of each month at **4:30-6pm**. Come and work on
Python code and hear what other people are working on. The first Friday will be

Mind" suitable to learners of all levels. Details are on the [events
