### So you still want to use some R

Sure, we all love Python, but sometimes we need some fancy stats or viz in R
that will just *get your job done*. No worries,
(rpy2)[http://rpy.sourceforge.net/] has your back!

As a demonstration, we'll show how you can use the awesome open and reproducible
science libraries from the [rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org) project from an
IPython notebook.

### Can it possibly be that easy?!?

Yes! Unless, as per usual, you are on windows. If you're interested, I'll talk
a bit about challenges that remain and what you might do to help.
