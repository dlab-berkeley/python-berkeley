title: Reproducible Science with Dexy and Docker
author: Dav Clark
---
### Documenting complex scientific workflows

@ananelson will give us an overview of using [Dexy](http://dexy.it) with
[Docker](http://docker.io). Ana is the primary author of Dexy, so it doesn't get
any more authoritative than this!

If there's interest, we may discuss some of the recent moves towards using the
[Berkeley Common Environment](http://collaboratool.berkeley.edu/using-bce.html)
with Docker.

### (Updates) Some links and stuff

We're currently keeping track of links and things on [this etherpad](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/pywork-dexy-docker).

Note that Dexy has a [great tutorial](http://dexy.it/docs/getting-started.html).

Follow [Ana](https://twitter.com/ananelson) and [Dexy](https://twitter.com/dexyit)
on Twitter.
