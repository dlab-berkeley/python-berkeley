### The Plan

Going forward, we'll try consolidating to just one meeting format, and do it
each week.

    Fridays 4-6pm
    D-Lab "Convening Room" (the classroom in our main space)
    First meeting: Friday 31st January 2014
    
We hope this time will attract both people who're too busy during the main
working day, and people who need to get home soon after work. Come and work on
your own projects, or talk to other people about your shared interests. We made
a map of topics people at the organisational meeting last week work on:

There will be [lightning talks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk)
at about 4.30pm. If you've found a cool new project, or you've got a great idea,
come and tell us about it.
