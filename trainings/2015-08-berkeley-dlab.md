title: Berkeley D-Lab -- August 2015
---
## Welcome to Python!

Below is a *schematic* of what the course will look like, including instructors
for each day. It provides info that complements the [info on the D-Lab
website](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/training/programming-fundamentals-python-intensive).

## Getting ready

We'll use the most recent version of BCE for VirtualBox. Links and instructions
are [here](http://bce.berkeley.edu/install.html). We'll use the Summer 2015
version (so if you have a previous version installed, please upgrade!). The
instructions recommend using an older (tested) version of VirtualBox, but I've
been happily using version 5.0 which should have better performance on Windows
-- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

And, while you're looking ahead to our training, check out our [Learning
Resources](learning_resources.html).

## Agenda and Instructors

### Friday, August 21

Instructor: @rdhyee

 - [Click here for the class Etherpad](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/2015-08-dlab-python)
 - Working with tabular data, standard library vs.  Pandas (the [standard
   documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.16.1/) is a bit
   tough, so I'd recommend [this
   book](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/python/9781449323592))
 - For plotting, the place to start is
   [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/index.html), but
   [Seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) looks nicer by
   default (matplotlib is also covered well in the above-mentioned
   [book](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/python/9781449323592)).
 - [Scrape the web](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/scenarios/scrape/)
 - Dav's current project to [scrape the CA Dept. of
   Ed.](https://github.com/davclark/LEA-scrapr)
 - Saving time with [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/)

We keep track of our *occasional Social Computing meetings* on our [mailing
list](https://www.mail-archive.com/socialcomputing@lists.berkeley.edu) --
**look in the sidebar, or above on mobile/narrow browsers.**

Upcoming events, and links to our mailing list and calendar, along with our
sister organization, The Hacker Within, are also available in the side bar at
the right. All are welcome! Sometimes there are better resources (like [Stack
Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com), or even just Google), but the Berkeley
Python community is always happy to get you moving in the right direction.
