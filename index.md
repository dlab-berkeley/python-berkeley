## For New Learners

Definitely take a look at our [Learning Resources](learning_resources.html), and
by our, I mean *our*! You can [submit your own changes via
GitHub](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-berkeley/edit/gh-pages/learning_resources.md)
to keep our learning resources current.

If you have no idea where to go, drop us a line on the [py4science
list](mailto:py4science@lists.berkeley.edu), or visit, call, or email us at the
[D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu)!

%^&* Also check us out on Twitter! WHAT IS OUR TWITTER HANDLE, Dav?!?

## Join The Community!

We keep track of our *Friday 4-6pm meetings* (this summer, about *every other
week*) on our [events page](/events).

Upcoming events, and links to our mailing list and calendar are always available
in the side bar at the right (or above on mobile/narrow browsers). All are
welcome! Sometimes there are better resources (like [Stack
Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com), or even just Google), but the Berkeley
Python community is always happy to get you moving in the right direction.

Check out the [Python Workers'
Party](events/2014/01/24/python-workers-party-rally.html) announcement for the
current history of the Berkeley Python community, including our
zany/revolutionary python party graphic!
