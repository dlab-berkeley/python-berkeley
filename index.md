## For New Learners

Definitely take a look at our [Learning Resources](learning-resources.html), and
by our, I mean *our*! You can [submit your own changes via
GitHub](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-berkeley/edit/gh-pages/learning-resources.html)
to keep our learning resources current.

If you have no idea where to go, drop us a line on the [py4science
list](mailto:py4science@lists.berkeley.edu), or visit, call, or email us at the
[D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu)!

## The Community

We are still working out the details of how we'll structure our community. For now, check out the [Python Workers' Party](#) announcement for the immediate future.

Upcoming events, and links to our mailing list and calendar are always available
in the side bar at the right. All are welcome! Sometimes there are better
resources (like [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com), or even just
Google), but the Berkeley Python community is always happy to get you moving in
the right direction.
