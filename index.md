## Python Practice

Python Practice is a working group at UC Berkeley, sponsored by the D-Lab. We hold informal biweekly meetings about special topics of the [Python programming language](https://python.org/). We focus especially in social science applications, data science, and visualization. 

This group is perfect for those who have some experience with Python, as we do expect some programming foundation. Much of the learning will be done in pairs or as a team. Everyone is welcome to attend any or all meetings throughout the semester.

**When:** Mondays from 4-5:30, through 4/24.

**Where:** [D-Lab Collaboratory](http://dlab.berkeley.edu/space), 356 Barrows Hall.

Please email facilitator [Megan Carey](mailto:mcarey@berkeley.edu) for more information. You can also [subscribe here](https://groups.google.com/a/lists.berkeley.edu/d/forum/pythonpractice) to our mailing list!
